# Multi-resolution selective distinction (version one)
This is a student project aiming to make the best use of a map space for pining icons or photos on the map. This should allow a maximum use of space and avoid overlap of icons a.s.a.p. More icons will show up as the map zooms in.

## Technologies
-   Base maps are provided by OpenLayers client using Openstreetmap map tiles and aerial image tiles.
-   MRSD structure and algorithm is implemented from scratch.
